Python for Data Science Essential Training Part 2 ,"<i>Python for Data Science Essential Training</i> is one of the most popular data science courses at LinkedIn Learning. It has now been updated and expanded to two parts—for even more hands-on experience with Python. In this course, instructor Lillian Pierson takes you step by step through a practical data science project: building machine learning models that can generate predictions and recommendations and automate routine tasks. Along the way, she shows how to perform linear and logistic regression, use K-means and hierarchal clustering, identify relationships between variables, and use other machine learning tools such as neural networks and Bayesian models. You should walk away from this training with hands-on coding experience that you can quickly apply to your own data science projects.",Course,2021-07-07 17:20 UTC,N/A,false,N/A,
Python: Working with Predictive Analytics,"Data can tell many stories: where it came from <i>and</i> where it’s going. Predictive analytics gives programmers a tool to tell stories about the future: to extract usable information and make accurate predictions. These predictions, in turn, allow business to make more informed, impactful decisions. Join Isil Berkun, data scientist, to explore predictive analytics with Python. Discover how to prepare data—fill in missing values, perform feature scaling, and more—and use prebuilt Python libraries to make and evaluate prediction models. She describes what models to use when, and explains the concepts in such a way that you can immediately apply them to your own work. By the end of the course, you’ll be able to leverage Python libraries like pandas and NumPy and choose the right prediction models for your projects.",Course,2022-02-23 18:40 UTC,N/A,false,N/A,
